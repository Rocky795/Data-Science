# Data Science Learning & Applied Projects

This repository contains my **hands-on data science learning journey**, focused on completing practical notebooks rather than only studying theory.  
The work covers data analysis, visualization, and machine learning using real datasets and end-to-end workflows.

The goal of this repository is simple:
**practice → apply → complete**, not just watch tutorials.
